Project Title: Sign Language Detection
Project Overview:
The Sign Language Detection project aims to facilitate communication between individuals with hearing or speech impairments and those who may not understand sign language. This project focuses on detecting and translating hand gestures (signs) into text or speech in real-time, utilizing computer vision and machine learning techniques. By recognizing hand gestures, the system can bridge communication gaps and help individuals with disabilities interact more seamlessly with the world around them.

Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to develop a model that can accurately detect and recognize various signs from a given sign language (e.g., American Sign Language or any other sign language) and translate them into readable text. The solution will use a combination of computer vision techniques and deep learning models, including hand tracking and gesture recognition, to perform real-time sign language detection.

Technologies Used:
Python 3.10: The main programming language used to implement the detection system.
TensorFlow: For building, training, and deploying deep learning models that recognize hand gestures.
Mediapipe: Used for real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition, leveraging its robust computer vision capabilities.
OpenCV: For handling image processing tasks and integrating the camera input for real-time gesture detection.
Keras: A high-level API built on top of TensorFlow, used for creating and training the sign language recognition model.
Cvzone: Simplifies computer vision tasks by providing modules such as the HandTrackingModule to make hand detection easier.
NumPy: For handling array operations and numerical computations during data preprocessing.
Features:
Real-time Hand Tracking and Detection: The system captures hand gestures in real-time through the webcam or camera feed. It tracks the hand movements, detects the number of fingers, and identifies the sign made by the user.

Sign Recognition and Translation: The model is trained to recognize various signs (gestures) from a specific sign language. Once a sign is detected, the system translates it into corresponding text.

Data Collection and Training: The system utilizes pre-trained models and also allows for new data collection, making it possible to expand the vocabulary of the signs recognized.

Feedback Mechanism: The system provides feedback to the user on the detected sign, ensuring correct recognition and enabling a more interactive experience.

User-friendly Interface: The project aims to create an intuitive and simple interface that allows users to interact with the system seamlessly, even without technical expertise.

Project Workflow:
Data Collection: The system captures hand gesture images and labels them with corresponding sign language symbols. This data is either pre-labeled or manually labeled by users during the data collection phase.

Model Training: A deep learning model is trained using TensorFlow and Keras. The training process involves feeding the hand gesture images into the model and learning from the patterns.

Hand Detection: The Mediapipe framework, along with Cvzone, tracks the hand in real-time from the webcam feed. The hand detection module identifies key hand landmarks to isolate specific gestures.

Gesture Classification: Once the hand gesture is detected, the classifier (loaded through TensorFlow) recognizes the specific sign based on the trained model.

Output: The recognized sign is translated into text, and it can optionally be converted into speech for auditory feedback, providing a multi-modal way to understand sign language.

Challenges:
Lighting Variations: Hand detection accuracy may vary under different lighting conditions.
Hand Occlusions: Situations where one hand covers the other may lead to incorrect recognition.
Complex Signs: Some gestures involve subtle hand movements, making them harder to detect and classify.
Future Enhancements:
Expand Gesture Vocabulary: Train the model with additional signs to cover a larger set of sign language gestures.
Multi-language Support: Extend the system to support different types of sign languages such as British Sign Language (BSL), French Sign Language (LSF), etc.
Speech Integration: Add the capability to convert recognized text into speech using text-to-speech (TTS) engines for more comprehensive communication.
Mobile Application: Develop a mobile app version of the system for broader accessibility.
